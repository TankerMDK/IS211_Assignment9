a number of extra steps were taken because I couldn't parse from cbs or yahoo.
a check was devised and the code is below.

url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Series_champions"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "lxml")

# Need to find the rows first.
tables = soup.find_all("table", class_="wikitable") #


print(f"Found {len(tables)} tables") removed. remnant. used to confirm the table.

# Gotta test to make sure table data is scraped.

if tables:
    first_table = tables[0]
    rows = first_table.find_all("tr")
    print(f"Found {len(rows)} rows in the first table")

    for i, row in enumerate(rows[:5]):  # Print first 5 rows for the test.
        colums = row.find_all(["th", "td"])
        text = [col.text.strip() for col in colums]
        print(f"Row {i+1}: {text}")
else:
    print("No tables found.")
